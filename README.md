# [Project 1: Predicting Life Ecpectancy --- WHO](https://github.com/Francis2381/Predicting-Life-Expectancy---WHO)

In this project, I explored working with the WHO data to predict
1. What factors affect the life expectancy of a country
2. Train an algorithm to predict the life expectancy of various countries
3. 

### What I did

+ I sourced for external data to compliment the data gotten from kaggle
+ Cleaned the data (Dealt with missing entries and outliers)
+ Created insightful and beautiful plots using matplotlib and seaborn
+ Trained a linear regression algorithm on the data and this helped me to determine what factors affect the life expectancy of a country more.
