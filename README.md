<h3 align="center">AIM</h3>
In this project, I explored working with the WHO data to achieve the following
1. What factors affect the life expectancy of a country
2. Train an algorithm to predict the life expectancy of various countries
3. Create beautiful plots to convey the insights from this analysis with little or no words spoken

<h3 align="center">What I did</h3>
+ I sourced for external data to compliment the data gotten from kaggle
+ Cleaned the data (Dealt with missing entries and outliers)
+ Created insightful and beautiful plots using matplotlib and seaborn
+ Carried out exploratory data analysis
+ Trained a linear regression algorithm on the data and this helped me to determine what factors affect the life expectancy of a country more.

This is a mini project that I carried out for no other reason than boredom and wanting to showcase some skills to impress myself.

<h3 align="center">AIM</h3>
1. Loaded and parsed a typical WhatsApp chat into a sorted dataframe
2. Cleaned the data and sorted it into various columns
3. Got some insight from the chat and created some Visualizations
4. Converted the texts to numbers using count vectorizer

<h3 align="center">What I did</h3>
+ I sorted the .txt data into a datafram having the following main columns sender,, 
+ Word cloud

I volunteered with the Nigerian Economic Summit Group to work on this project, I was part of the team charged to analyse series of data and come up with insights which are meant to be presented at the Nigerian Economic Summit, October 2019, where various insights that might influence economic decisions will be discussed. In this project notebook, we:
+ Extracted the needed data for the analysis from an excel workbook
+ Performed a predictive analysis on the data
